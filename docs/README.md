# Get documentation
Documentation, as the code itself, is still very much work-in-progress. Any help enjoyed!

1. [Overview in github wiki](https://github.com/Traderain/Wolven-kit/wiki/Codebase-structure)
2. Generate [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) comments. It will create a html directory in docs, with lots of files, among which index.html : you want to open that one in a web browser. At repository root on linux :
>  "doxygen doxygen.conf"
3. Read code and comments in code.
Good luck!
